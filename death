What happens after we die?
What if there's actually reincarnation?
So what are the chances that after we die we just get transfered into one of the alternate dimensions.
And we continue to keep our memory of the previous lives in the previous dimensions. 




Is it too psychotic that am interested to end my life just to see what we'll happen after that? Like am not depressed or anything(maybe a little) but doesn't it make you curious about what lies after this life?
	Is there another world waiting for us or we just get to restart our lives in this place again!! Do we'll keep our memories or we'll start fresh!! 
	Some could say that we don't keep our previous memories cause if we would we'll be having some previous memories in this life too .. But that has a plot hole... What if we are the new batches that just got life... We don't have any previous memories cause we didn't live any lives yet...
