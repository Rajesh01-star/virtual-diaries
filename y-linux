So recently when I asked one of my friends to switch to linux, he asked me "WHY" and even though I am using linux for quite some time now I couldn't give him a proper reason at that time accept for the "customization".
Now am listing it out her :-
1)Security (You don't need antiviruses and all & no unwanted antivirus notificatins)
2)Great helping hand if you're a programmer(you'll agree to it)
3)A reliable software store(you don't have to go to shady websites to download apps. Only use "sudo apt install <package name>")
4)No rediculous software updates (if you want to update you do otherwise you don't. Simple as that)
5)No need to reboot your machine unless you want to.
6)Task automation (bash scripting to do everything)
7)Performance
8)Usefull Error messages(No more "Ooops something went wrong!!")
9)Hell yeah CUSTOMIzation
